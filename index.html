    <h1>My favorite classcial composers</h1>
    <h2>favorite baroque composer</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite baroque composer is <b><i>Teleman</i></b>.<br> I love him for his beautiful
      trumpet duets that will instantly transport you to a giant ballroom with
      giant crystal chandeliers where everyone is dressed to their finest.
    </p>
    <h2>favorite classic composer</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite composer from the classic era has to be <b><i>Mozart</i></b>.<br> I shouldn't
      need an explanation for this one but if you still want one go see his
      requiem live and youwill be incredibly moved.
    </p>
    <h2>favorite romantic composer</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite romantic composer is definetly <b><i>Brahms</i></b>.<br> Brahms' symphony number
      two is one of the most soothing pieces of music there is. The Brahms
      lullaby is very similar to a motif the cellos have in this piece so I
      could fall asleep to it anyday.
    </p>
    <h2>favorite modern composer</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite modern composer is <b><i>Hindemith</i></b>.<br> The Hindemith Trumpet Sonata is
      my favorite solo piece to play ever and I think that his "morgenmusik" is
      the best brass quintet you can get.
